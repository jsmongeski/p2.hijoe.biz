<p>Homebrewbuzz is currently my project 2 for CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Applications at Harvard Extension School.  It is a discussion forum for all things beer brewing. Currently it features a blog where users can post their ideas on brewing, and follow one another's posts.</p>  +1 features include 1. ability to create/store/edit a user's profile, 2. sends an email acknowledgement to users upon signup, 3. checks forms for valid email addresses and blank lines, giving specific error messages for both conditions, and the chance to resubmit a corrected form. 4. It also checks if a registering user is already signed up.</p>
<p> Note that you can click on the beer mug, "Homebrewbuzz!", or on or around the "Home" link on the nav bar, to go to the home page.</p>
